## Inspiration
Demonstrating expertise in Vue.js, by actively address local challenges, leveraging technology to enhance solutions. Concurrently, also to proudly promote our family homestay business, fostering a welcoming environment for travelers. Our commitment extends beyond business – we strive to contribute to the cultural and touristic richness of Terengganu, making it a more recognized and sought-after destination.

## Why I Made This
Embarking on the journey of mastering full-stack application development, I leverage my familiarity with Python and JavaScript, diving into the awaited realm of Vue.js. The Flask-powered backend seamlessly manages database operations for booking dates, serving as a crucial data source. This data facilitates Vue.js to effortlessly disable booked dates within the date-picker component. Notably, in line with the side project's nature, no sensitive information is stored or handled in the database. All booking communications are securely conducted through WhatsApp. Additionally, an admin page in the backend simplifies data management for business handlers, enabling easy reading and writing of data.

## Technology Involved
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstap
  - Frontend framework: Vue.js (VueCLI)
  - UI framework: Vuetify
  - State-management: Pinia.js
  - Backend: Flask (Python)
  - Database: SQLite
  - Deployment Service: Render (backend), Vercel (frontend)
